# Starbucks Marketing Offers Analysis and Personalisation

## Project Motivation
This project will be using a dataset that contains a simulated data that mimics the behaviour of Starbucks customers when various types of promotion. The goal is to understand the success rate of an offer depending on the customer demographics.
Additionally, a few predictive models will be explored to see if a customer is likely to purchase, given a specific type of offer.
