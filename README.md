## Project Motivation
This project will be using a dataset that contains a simulated data that mimics the behaviour of Starbucks customers when various types of promotion. The goal is to understand the success rate of an offer depending on the customer demographics.
Additionally, a few predictive models will be explored to see if a customer is likely to purchase, given a specific type of offer.

## Dataset Overview
Here are the datasets that are used in the notebook and can be found inside of the `data` folder:
1. Portfolio: Details of the offers that Starbucks will be sending to its customers.
2. Profile: Information of the Starbucks customers, such as demographic details or the length that they have been customers of Starbucks.
3. Transcript: Records of offers that each Starbucks customer has received.
